## Aim:

* Demonstrate the processing using ([clusterProfiler](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler), [enrichR](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)).


## ClusterProfiler

With clusterProfiler you can explore functional characteristics of both coding and non-coding genomics data for thousands of species with up-to-date gene annotation. (Introduction by [YuLab](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler))

We applied clusterProfiler GO analysis on every gene set (exclusive, buffered, intensified, ) on biological process.
